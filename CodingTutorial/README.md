# Practice programs

[Makefile](./Makefile)  -- This is an example of Makefile, which can also compile all the exercises here.

[HelloWorld.c](./HelloWorld.c)  -- example of a c program with differences between printf and fprintf

**Pointers**

[Pointer.c](./Pointer.c) -- example of passing pointer as a parameter of a function

[Array1D.c](./Array1D.c) -- dynamically allocate array

[Array3D.c](./Array3D.c) -- dynamically allocate 3D array with time comparison, cache misses

**Structures **
[Structure.c](Structure.c) -- understand the concept of a structure with IO

[StructureArray.c](StructureArray.c) -- typedef and passing of structure pointer to function

[StructurePointer.c](StructurePointer.c) -- pass pointers to structures around with functions with dynamical allocate memory

[pi.c](./pi.c)  -- calculation of PI with OpenMP

[utility.h](utility.h)  [utility.c](utility.c)  -- Useful functions
