Programs to test the theory ACO classes

*[hello.c](./hello.c)* Hello world program in C

*[hello_openmp.c](hello_openmp.c)* Each of the cores in your computer say hello

*[bitshift_test.c](bitshift_test.c)* Test what the bitshift function does

*[cpi_test.c](cpi_test.c)* Test the difference in computational time of using x*x*x or pow(x,3)

*[cache_test.c](cache_test.c)* Test the difference of cache miss or hit.

*[serial_2a.c](serial_2a.c)* Program that generates an array of elements 2*(previous element)

*[serial_b.c](serial_b.c)* The same as serial_2a.c but having independent tasks.

*[par_b.c](par_b.c)* Parallelisation of serial_b.c

*[par_b_vars.c](par_b_vars.c)* Parallelisation of serial_b.c to play with having private and shared variables.

*[par_b_sch.c](par_b_sch.c)* As par_b.c, to explore the option to schedule

*[par_b_func.c](par_b_func.c)* As par_b.c writing the independent task into a function
