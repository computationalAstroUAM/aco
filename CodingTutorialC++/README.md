# ACO_practice

This project is written in C++ and includes the following files:

## Source Files

### [`overflow.cpp`](./overflow.cpp)

This file contains a program that demonstrates integer and floating point overflow and underflow. It also demonstrates the precision error that can occur with floating point numbers.

### [`MainArgs.cpp`](./MainArgs.cpp)

This file contains a program that prints the name of the program and all the arguments passed to it.

### [`openmp-example.cpp`](./openmp-example.cpp)

This file contains a program that uses OpenMP to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 1e5. It sets the number of threads to the number of processors available, and each thread calculates a portion of the sum.

### [`openmp-nested-for-loop.cpp`](./openmp-nested-for-loop.cpp)

This file contains a program that demonstrates the use of nested for loops in OpenMP. It shows how to parallelize both outer and inner loops for efficient computation.

### [`openmp-no-parallel.cpp`](./openmp-no-parallel.cpp)

This file contains a program that demonstrates the cases that OpenMP parallelization can not be used. It shows how a program behaves when run on a single thread.

### [`openmp-parallel-output.cpp`](./openmp-parallel-output.cpp)

This file contains a program that demonstrates the use of OpenMP for parallel output. It shows how to write to different files in parallel using OpenMP.

### [`openmp-sections.cpp`](./openmp-sections.cpp)

This file contains a program that demonstrates the use of sections in OpenMP. It shows how to divide a program into sections that can be executed in parallel.

### [`problemtic_program_for_gdb.cpp`](./problemtic_program_for_gdb.cpp)

This file contains a program that is designed to be debugged using GDB. It includes intentional errors that can be investigated using the debugger.


### [`pi.cpp`](./pi.cpp)

This file contains a program that calculates the value of pi using the Leibniz formula for Ï€. The program uses OpenMP for parallel computation, allowing it to calculate pi to a high degree of precision in a shorter amount of time. The number of threads used for the computation can be specified as a command-line argument when running the program.
To build and run `pi.cpp`, use the make command followed by the name of the file (without the .cpp extension), and then run the resulting executable with the number of threads as an argument:

### [`pointer-dam.cpp`](./pointer-dam.cpp)

This file contains a program that demonstrates the use of pointers and memory management in C++. It includes examples of pointer arithmetic, dynamic memory allocation, and memory leaks.

### [`pointer-dam3D.cpp`](./pointer-dam3D.cpp)

This file extends the concepts demonstrated in `pointer-dam.cpp` to three dimensions. It includes examples of working with 3D arrays and pointers, including dynamic memory allocation for 3D arrays.

### [`IO.cpp`](./IO.cpp)

This file contains a program that demonstrates how to write and read array data to and from a text file and a binary file in C++. It includes examples of using the `fstream` library for file I/O operations.

### [`pointer-update-parameter.cpp`](./pointer-update-parameter.cpp)

This file contains a program that demonstrates how to use pointers to change the value of a parameter inside a function. It includes examples of passing pointers to functions and updating the value they point to.

### [`class.cpp`](./class.cpp)

This file contains a program that demonstrates the use of classes and objects in C++. It includes examples of defining classes, creating objects, and accessing class members.

### [`structure.cpp`](./structure.cpp)

This file contains a program that demonstrates the use of structures in C++. It includes examples of defining structures, creating structure variables, and accessing structure members.

### [`different_arrays.cpp`](./different_arrays.cpp)

This file contains a program that demonstrates the use of different types of arrays in C++. It includes examples of C++ default array, std::array, dynamically allocated array and std::vector.

### [`vector.cpp`](./vector.cpp)

This file contains a program that demonstrates the use of std::vector in C++. It includes examples of creating vectors, adding elements to vectors, accessing vector elements, and different vector built-in functions.

### [`Sort_index.cpp`](./Sort_index.cpp)

This file contains a program that demonstrates how to sort an array and get the index of the sorted array in C++. It includes examples of using std::sort and std::vector.

### [`mpi_example.cpp`](./mpi_example.cpp)

The mpi_example.cpp file is a C++ program that demonstrates the use of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for parallel computing. The program calculates the sum of an array of numbers, distributing the task across multiple processes.

To compile and run this program, an MPI implementation (like Open MPI or MPICH) needs to be installed on the system. The compilation command might look like `mpic++ mpi_example.cpp -o mpi_example`, and the run command might look like `mpirun -np 4 ./mpi_example`, where `-np 4` specifies to run the program with 4 processes.

```bash
make pi
./pi 4 This will build `pi.cpp` and run the resulting `pi` executable with 4 threads.
```

### [`segfault_examples.cpp`](./segfault_examples.cpp)

This file contains a program that demonstrates the use of segfault examples in C++. It includes examples of segfaults and how to handle them.

## Build Files

### [`Makefile`](./Makefile)

This file is used to build the project. It includes targets for building the entire project, as well as individual targets for `overflow.cpp` and `MainArgs.cpp`. The `clean` target is used to remove the built executables and object files.

### [`CMakeLists.txt`](./CMakeLists.txt)

This file is used by CMake to generate a build system for the project. It specifies the minimum required version of CMake, the name of the project, the C++ standard to use, and the source files to compile.

## How to Build

To build the entire project, use the `make` command:

```bash
make
```

To build individual files, use the make command followed by the name of the file (without the .cpp extension):
```bash
make overflow
make MainArgs
make openmp-example
make pi
make pointer-dam
make pointer-dam3D
make pointer-update-parameter
make IO
make class
make structure
make different_arrays
make vector
make Sort_index
make openmp-nested-for-loop
make openmp-no-parallel
make openmp-parallel-output
make openmp-sections
make problemtic_program_for_gdb
```

To clean up the built files, use the make clean command:
```bash
make clean
```
