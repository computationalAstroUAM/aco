You need to present a small project work at the end of the course.

The project can either be a numerical investigation of some scientific problem or a literature research on a certain subject related to computational astrophysics. While you are free to propose the actual project and synchronize it with your teacher(s), we also provide a list of suggestions [here](./data/projects.pdf)
